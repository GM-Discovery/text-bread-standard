# 🌾 The Bread Standard Constitution
**One Step Better: A Post-Hunger, Post-Extraction Society**

Welcome to the public repository for **The Bread Standard Constitution** — a full-spectrum framework for democratic participation, regenerative economics, and inclusive governance rooted in dignity, sustainability, and shared stewardship.
---
## 🧭 Core Premise

We live in systems that fail to recognize our inherent worth.

**The Bread Standard** changes that by aligning governance and economics with 8 core values:

🫶 Love | 🔍 Truth | ⚖️ Equity | 🧠 Well-being | 🌱 Stewardship | 🧩 Community | 💡 Innovation | 🕊️ Freedom

At the heart of this framework is a **Trust Point System** and a **Bread-Based Economic Anchor** that redefines value through human needs rather than speculative markets.
