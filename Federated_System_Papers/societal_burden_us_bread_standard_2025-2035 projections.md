## Societal Burden Calculation

### Annual Base Burden: $6.34 trillion
- Represents core societal needs without reserve building

### Reserve Building (Years 1-7): $950 billion annually
- Accelerated development of 7-year reserves across all essential categories

### Total Annual Burden (Years 1-7): $7.29 trillion
- Represents approximately 27.5% of current U.S. GDP
- Approximately $21,800 per capita annually

### Total Annual Burden (After Year 7): $6.34 trillion
- Represents approximately 24% of current U.S. GDP
- Approximately $19,000 per capita annually

## Resource Allocation Hierarchy

Based on the Constitution's resource allocation hierarchy, projected funds beyond the Societal Burden:

### 1. Burden Shortfall Fund
- Current allocation: Included in base burden calculation
- Reserve maintenance: $150 billion annually after Year 7
- Dividend potential: None initially, possible after Year 10

### 2. General Defense Fund
- Already included in base calculation: $350 billion
- Capped at this predetermined budget level
- Represents significant reduction from current military spending (~$850-900B)

### 3. Society Flourishment Fund
- Year 1-7: $100-300 billion annually (depending on economic transition success)
- After Year 7: $550-750 billion annually
- Allocation through democratic governance application:
  - Special works projects: ~30%
  - Scientific advancement: ~25%
  - Ecological initiatives: ~20%
  - Cultural development: ~15%
  - Disaster preparedness: ~10%

## Per Person Burden Distribution

### Average Adult Share: $27,500 annually
- Base burden contribution
- Adjusted for productivity and capability

### Distribution Mechanism:
- Minimum compensation calibrated to earn burden share in 20-35 hour work week
- Progressive taxation on luxury earnings
- Annual Jubilation process for those unable to meet burden threshold

## Implementation Notes

### Transition Phase (Years 1-3):
- Focus on essential systems stabilization
- Parallel governance application development
- Community-level pilot programs
- Agricultural system adaptation to Bread Standard metrics

### Stabilization Phase (Years 4-7):
- Completion of reserve building
- Full healthcare system transition
- Housing deficit reduction
- Environmental remediation acceleration

### Maintenance Phase (Year 8+):
- Reduced burden after reserve completion
- Shift to system optimization
- Increased flourishment fund allocation
- Long-term sustainability investments

## Economic Impact Projections

### GDP Redistribution:
- Labor share increase to 65-70% (from current ~50%)
- Corporate profit normalization to 8-10% (from current ~12%)
- Public commons increase to 25-30% (from current ~20%)

### Wealth Distribution Shift:
- Top 10% wealth share: 30-35% (down from ~70%)
- Top 1% wealth share: 10-12% (down from ~35%)
- Bottom 50% wealth share: 25-30% (up from ~2%)

### Productivity Impact:
- Initial 2-3% GDP growth reduction during transition
- Long-term 1-2% GDP growth increase from wellbeing improvements
- Significant reduction in crisis-related economic disruptions
- Enhanced economic resilience through reserve systems
