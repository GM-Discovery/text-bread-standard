# THE BREAD STANDARD CONSTITUTION

*Draft Version 0.2*

## PREAMBLE

We, the people of kindness, offer through this digital document, a vision of a better world and better society than the one we were born into. In order to form a more perfect union, we redraft our foundational documents to better highlight the truths necessary for establishing justice, ensuring domestic tranquility, providing for the common defense, and securing the blessings of freedom and prosperity for ourselves and our descendants.

We enshrine into the highest law a series of core values from which we derive virtue and governance through their hierarchical implementation:

1. **Love** \- The recognition of inherent worth and commitment to human flourishing  
2. **Truth** \- Commitment to honest inquiry and advancement of understanding  
3. **Mercy, Equity, and Responsibility** \- Compassion balanced with fair outcomes and accountability  
4. **Well-being** \- The physical, mental, and emotional health of all community members  
5. **Environmental Stewardship** \- Sustainable relationships with natural systems  
6. **Community** \- Meaningful connection and mutual support  
7. **Innovation** \- Creative problem-solving and adaptation  
8. **Freedom** \- Self-determination within boundaries that protect others

These values shall guide all interpretation of this constitution, with higher values taking precedence when tensions arise between them.

## ARTICLE I: FOUNDATIONAL RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES

Recognizing that all persons possess inherent worth deserving of protection and respect, we establish these foundational guarantees:

1. **Environmental Integrity** \- All persons have the right to clean air, potable water, and a habitable environment. No entity may claim exclusive ownership of essential natural resources necessary for life. The atmosphere, water systems, and other life-sustaining commons shall be protected as collective trusts managed for the benefit of all living beings, present and future.  
     
2. **Physical Necessities** \- All persons are guaranteed access to nutritious food, safe shelter, and basic healthcare as fundamental expressions of their inherent worth. These necessities shall be included in the societal burden calculation and prioritized in all resource allocations.  
     
3. **Bodily Autonomy** \- Each person maintains sovereignty over their own body, including decisions about medical care, reproduction, and physical integrity. This right shall be balanced with community well-being through democratic processes guided by medical expertise, compassion, and respect for diverse perspectives.  
     
4. **Democratic Participation** \- All persons possess equal standing in governance through the trust point system, with special protections ensuring the voices of vulnerable populations remain influential in decisions affecting them.  
     
5. **Knowledge Access** \- All persons have the right to education, information, and the tools necessary for meaningful participation in society. Deliberate misinformation that undermines collective decision-making shall not receive constitutional protection.  
     
6. **Dignity in Treatment** \- No person shall be subjected to cruel, degrading, or inhumane treatment regardless of circumstance. Justice systems shall prioritize restoration and community safety over retribution.

7. **Fundamental Egality** - All persons possess equal inherent worth and dignity regardless of any characteristic or circumstance, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, neurological difference, socioeconomic status, religious belief, national origin, or language. This recognition of equal worth transcends mere equal treatment or outcome, establishing that the value hierarchy applies fully and without diminishment to every person. Systems shall be designed to recognize and protect this inherent egality, ensuring that historical patterns of marginalization do not persist in new forms. The equal worth of each person exists independent of their ability to articulate or advocate for themselves, with appropriate protections ensuring this recognition manifests in all aspects of community life.

On matters where profound ethical disagreement exists, this constitution establishes processes for ongoing dialogue rather than imposing singular definitions. These processes shall ensure:

- Representation of diverse perspectives, including those most directly affected  
- Incorporation of relevant expertise  
- Transparency in deliberation  
- Regular reassessment as understanding evolves  
- Protection against domination by temporary majorities

## ARTICLE II: SOVEREIGNTY AND GOVERNANCE

### Section 1: Document Sovereignty

This constitution represents the highest law within communities that ratify it. It supersedes all prior legal frameworks where conflicts exist. Its interpretation shall remain guided by the value hierarchy established in the preamble, with love and truth serving as the primary interpretive principles.

### Section 2: Federated Governance

Governance shall operate through a multi-layered federated system that balances local autonomy with collective coordination:

1. **Individual Sovereignty** \- Persons retain all rights not explicitly delegated, with decisions affecting primarily the individual remaining under personal authority.

2. **Organizational Implementation** \- Organizations of people formed as a validator, exchange operator, or for other formal governance via application usage.  
     
3. **Community Governance** \- Local communities (including neighborhoods, towns, and cities) maintain authority over matters primarily affecting their members, including implementation of shared burdens and local resource allocation.  
     
4. **County Coordination** \- County-level bodies coordinate between communities within their boundaries, especially for resource sharing and infrastructure that crosses community lines.  
     
5. **State/Provincial Governance** \- State or provincial bodies address larger-scale coordination needs, particularly for resource management and regional infrastructure.  
     
6. **Regional Coordination** \- Geographic regions establish coordination bodies for matters crossing state/provincial boundaries, including environmental management, larger infrastructure systems, and resource sharing across broader areas.  
     
7. **Societal Federated Congress** \- A representative body composed of validators from all participating regions shall address matters requiring society-wide coordination. This body shall operate without permanent membership, instead consisting of validators weighted by trust point allocation through the governance application.  
     
8. **Global Federated Congress** \- The highest level of coordination addressing planet-wide concerns, including climate stability, international relations, and global commons management. As adoption expands, this body may eventually merge with the Societal Federated Congress when global participation is achieved.

Each level of this federated system shall maintain sovereignty within its appropriate domain while recognizing the authority of higher levels in matters that inherently cross boundaries. The principle of subsidiarity shall apply, with decisions made at the most local level possible where effectiveness can be maintained.

### Section 3: Trust Point System

Democratic participation shall operate through the trust point system rather than simple majority voting:

1. **Base Allocation** \- Every adult receives one trust point annually, with additional points (up to a maximum of ten) available through education, advocacy, and essential work.  
     
2. **Point Distribution** \- Individuals may allocate their points to validators representing their values and interests, with annual expiration requiring conscious reallocation.  
     
3. **Distribution Limits** \- No individual validator may receive more than one point from any person, and religious or political organizations are limited to 0.1 points per person, regardless of total allocation.  
     
4. **Protected Voices** \- The system shall include mechanisms ensuring that minority perspectives with high impact receive appropriate consideration in all decisions.  
     
5. **Vulnerability Protection** \- People with developmental disabilities, dementia, and other conditions affecting traditional participation shall receive maximum possible trust point allocation, with appropriate advocates using these points to ensure their interests remain influential.  
     
6. **Impact Assessment** \- All significant governance decisions require formal assessment of impacts across diverse populations, with particular attention to those most affected.  
     
7. **Transparent Weighting** \- All validator influence shall be visible through the governance application, preventing hidden power concentration.  
     
8. **Point Decay** \- Points invested for extended periods shall decay at a rate that balances stability with responsiveness. Points invested for a full year shall decay at 0.2 annually.  
     
9. **Economic Integration** \- Trust point allocations shall influence both political decisions and resource allocation priorities through the governance application, creating direct connection between democratic participation and economic outcomes.

### Section 4: Validator Councils

8. **Intergenerational Consideration** \- Evaluating all significant decisions for their impact on future generations and environmental sustainability.  
     
9. **Cross-Domain Coordination** \- Collaborating with other validator councils on interconnected issues rather than operating in isolation.  
     
10. **Education and Outreach** \- Making specialized knowledge accessible to the broader community through teaching, documentation, and public engagement.

Individual validators or councils may take one of several forms:

- Single-person validators with specialized expertise  
- Small collectives organized around particular knowledge domains  
- Larger organizations with internal democratic structures  
- Elected bodies representing specific communities or regions

All validators must operate exchanges where trust points can be allocated and managed with complete transparency. These exchanges form the practical mechanism through which democratic participation flows through the governance application.

## ARTICLE III: ECONOMIC STRUCTURE

### Section 1: The Bread Standard Foundation

The economic system shall be grounded in the Bread Standard as its fundamental measure of value:

1. **Bread Standard Definition** \- The value of one standard loaf of bread, produced according to established specifications, shall serve as the baseline unit of value ($1) against which all other economic values are measured.  
     
2. **Standard Recipe** \- Agricultural Validators shall establish and maintain the specific recipe for the standard loaf, including defined ingredients, proportions, and production methods. This standard recipe shall include basic components such as wheat flour, eggs, cream, yeast, salt, plus one of three specified oils and one of six approved herbs/spices.  
     
3. **Valuation Method** \- The price of producing the standard loaf in designated locations determines the base unit of currency. This creates a direct connection between currency and essential human needs.  
     
4. **Verification System** \- Regular audits (quarterly) with biennial deep review shall ensure the integrity of the standard. Small-scale operations with high trust scores shall serve as verification checks against corporate standard production.  
     
5. **Regional Adaptation** \- Societies without traditional bread staples may implement approved equivalency systems, connecting local essential foods to the broader standard through regulated conversion protocols.

### Section 2: The Societal Burden

This constitution shall become effective through a multi-phase process of democratic adoption beginning with individual ratification through the governance application, followed by community adoption when sufficient members affirm, regional integration of participating communities, and societal transition as recognition expands, with implementation timelines established by each adopting community according to the guidelines detailed in "The Bread Standard: Implementation Pathway" framework.

### Section 2: Amendment Process

Amendments may be proposed through governance application initiatives, validator council proposals, or direct citizen proposals meeting threshold requirements, with all proposals undergoing public deliberation, impact assessment, and validator analysis before adoption, requiring substantial trust point support, minimum participation thresholds, and demonstrated alignment with constitutional values as specified in "The Bread Standard: Constitutional Maintenance" protocols.

### Section 3: Resolution of Constitutional Questions
