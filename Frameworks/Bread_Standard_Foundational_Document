# The Bread Standard: An Economic and Governance Framework

## Philosophical Foundation

This system is built upon a clear value hierarchy that informs all aspects of its design:

1. **Love** - Recognition of inherent worth and commitment to human flourishing
2. **Truth** - Commitment to honest inquiry and advancement of understanding
3. **Mercy, Equity, and Responsibility** - Compassion, fair outcomes, and accountability
4. **Well-being** - Physical, mental, and emotional health of community members
5. **Environmental Stewardship** - Sustainable relationships with natural systems
6. **Community** - Meaningful connection and mutual support
7. **Innovation** - Creative problem-solving and adaptation
8. **Freedom** - Self-determination within boundaries that protect others

This hierarchy creates a distinctive approach where values commonly placed at the top in other systems (like freedom) are understood as meaningful only within the context of more fundamental values. The primacy of love means all systems are designed first to recognize inherent worth and foster flourishing.

## Trust Points: The Social Currency

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Base Allocation | 1 point granted to every person simply for existing |
| Additional Points | Earned through education, advocacy, essential work |
| System Limits | Capped maximum to prevent class stratification |
| Validator Role | Citizens with expertise can serve as validators in their field |
| Democratic Weight | Trust points influence voting power in relevant domains |
| Yearly Allocation | Points must be reallocated annually |
| Decay Rate | Investment length (up to 5 years) minus 1/3 rounded up |

Trust points function as a form of social currency separate from financial wealth. They represent societal contribution, expertise, and community recognition. Unlike traditional wealth, trust points cannot be inherited or purchased, only earned through meaningful participation.

### Trust Point Safeguards

- **Validator Caps**: Religious and party organizations limited to 0.10 points per person
- **Organization Limits**: Organizations capped at 1 point maximum allocation per person
- **Practical Validation Limits**: Validators limited by reasonable case management loads
- **Protected Population Enhancement**: People with developmental disabilities, dementia, etc., receive maximum possible trust point allocation
- **Advocacy System**: Caretakers and advocates use these points to ensure vulnerable voices remain influential

### Earning Additional Trust Points

- **Education**: Specialized knowledge and training
- **Advocacy**: Representing those unable to advocate for themselves
- **Essential Work**: Taking on necessary but undesirable roles
- **Community Service**: Contributions to local well-being

## Agricultural Foundation: The Bread Standard

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Currency Basis | The "Loaf-Backed Dollar" - Value pegged to standardized bread recipe |
| Standard Recipe | Wheat flour, eggs, cream, yeast, salt, plus one of three oils and one of six herbs/spices |
| Valuation Method | Price of standard loaf in designated international locations determines $1 value |
| Economic Safeguard | Regular audits (quarterly) with biennial deep review |
| Philosophical Foundation | Connecting currency directly to essential human needs as an expression of love |

### Case Study: Frank the Agricultural Validator

Frank represents the elevated status of agricultural work in this society, where essential production is highly valued and integrated into governance:

- **Education Path**: State Junior College → Advanced agricultural studies (equivalent to graduate level)
- **Trust Recognition**: Earned additional trust points through education and generational farming knowledge
- **Current Role**: Runs specialty demonstration farm while serving as validator with constituent trust points
- **Daily Routine**: Pre-dawn animal care → Administrative work → Site visits/teleconferences → Evening farm maintenance
- **Constituency Engagement**: Weekly governance app checks, monthly regional visits, bimonthly extended trips
- **Cultural Position**: Farm serves as educational tourism destination while maintaining authentic production

## Governance Application

The governance app serves as the technological infrastructure for democratic participation, implementing the Protected Voices Mechanism to ensure all perspectives are appropriately considered in decision-making.

### Key Components

- **Trust Point Allocation**: Interface for yearly allocation of trust points to validators
- **Impact Assessment** (0-10 Likert scale): Quantifying how decisions affect different stakeholders
- **Quality Assessment**: Peer review of impact claims to prevent manipulation
- **Visibility Algorithm**: Ensuring minority perspectives with high impact remain visible
- **Response Weighting**: Balancing majority views with minority perspectives based on impact
- **Ranked Choice Integration**: Nuanced preference expression beyond binary yes/no decisions
- **Protected Voices Reports**: Required minority perspective documentation for all governance decisions
- **Blockchain Verification**: Federated system ensuring transparency and security
- **Notification System**: Alerts for relevant votes and policy proposals

This approach moves beyond both simple majority rule and consensus requirements, creating nuanced decision processes that balance efficiency with inclusion.

## Economic Structure: The Burden and Flourishment System

### Fundamental Calculations

1. **The Societal Burden**: Total annual cost to maintain society
   - Food production (calculated by farming collective)
   - Housing (maintenance and new construction)
   - Healthcare (universal coverage)
   - Emergency services
   - Justice system
   - Basic infrastructure
   - Essential mental health resources (including basic art supplies)

2. **Shared Cost Distribution**: Equal division of burden among citizens
   - Adjusted for those unable to bear full share
   - Annual jubilation (debt forgiveness) for qualifying individuals

3. **Total Produced Wealth**: Annual economic output of nation
   - Includes all tax revenue and debt payments
   - Governance exports offset portion of burden

### Burden Shortfall Management
- Quarterly audits with biennial deep reviews
- Seven-year reserve maintained
- Surplus distributed as dividends and tax refunds

## Housing System

Housing represents a fundamental right managed through multiple approaches:

- **Hereditary Occupation**: Primary method of housing allocation
- **Community Queues**: Placement based on work proximity, community ties, family connections
- **Eminent Domain**: More frequently used to optimize density and community needs
- **Landlord Regulation**: Strict management requirements with land forfeiture for violations
- **Development Mandates**: Government intervention when housing shortages occur
- **Needs-Based Allocation**: Family size, disabilities, and family dynamics considered in housing assignments

## Healthcare System

- Universal coverage as part of societal burden
- Government controlled baseline plan required for all citizens
- Regulated private options available to compete with government plan
- Integration with community health initiatives

## Taxation Framework

| Income Bracket (Post-Burden) | Tax Rate | Notes |
|------------------------------|----------|-------|
| Below Burden Threshold | Debt Forgiven | New debt accrued annually |
| Minimal Surplus | Sales Tax Only | Minimal taxation at this level |
| $100,000-$300,000 | 10% of Luxury Earnings | Most common bracket |
| $300,000-$1,000,000 | ~70% of Surplus | Graduated scale |
| $1,000,000-$1,100,000 | 71-79% | Stepped scale increasing by 1% per bracket |
| $1,100,000-$10,000,000 | 80% | |
| $10,000,000-$100,000,000 | 90% | Stepped scale between thresholds |
| Business >$100,000,000 | 100% | Complete recapture of excess |

### Additional Wealth Controls
- Maximum personal wealth caps
- Maximum business wealth caps
- Excess wealth taxation

## Resource Allocation Hierarchy

1. **Burden Shortfall Fund** (Primary)
   - Maintains seven-year reserve
   - Returns dividends when surplus exists

2. **General Defense Fund** (Secondary)
   - Exclusively for sovereignty protection
   - Capped at predetermined budget

3. **Society Flourishment Fund** (Tertiary)
   - Special works projects
   - Disaster relief
   - Ecological/environmental initiatives
   - Scientific advancement
   - Democratic allocation through governance application

## Implementation Inflection Points

Three major transitions would be required to transition to this system:

1. **The Great Jubilation**: Debt forgiveness and establishment of first societal burden
2. **Sovereignty Resolution**: Reconciliation between parallel society and sovereign nation(s)
3. **Application Ratification**: Formal acceptance of governance application articles

## Employment Structure

- Free market approach with guarantees
- Minimum wages calibrated to earn basic burden cost with 20-35 hour work weeks
- Luxury earnings potential to attract talent and incentivize effort
- Expected industry transformation as incentives shift from profit maximization to human flourishing
- Emergence of new occupations focused on community building and creative expression

## Philosophical Underpinnings

This economic system reflects core values:
- Essential work (especially food production) deserves highest recognition
- Wealth concentration undermines societal health
- Transparency in economic calculation builds trust
- Democratic oversight of algorithms prevents technocratic control
- Luxury is permitted but excess is recaptured for collective benefit
- Creative expression is a fundamental need, not a luxury
- Housing and healthcare are rights, not privileges
- Truth and love form the foundation for all system design
