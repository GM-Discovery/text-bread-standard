# The Bread Standard: Trust Point System Technical Integration
*April 30, 2025*

## 1. System Overview

This document details the technical implementation of the Trust Point System within The Bread Standard framework, establishing how trust allocation, validator verification, and the governance application function together to create a democratic system grounded in both values and practical expertise. This system creates transparent accountability while supporting both individual agency and collective decision-making, with special emphasis on the role of value validators in sectors essential to maintaining the society's infrastructure.

### 1.1 Philosophical Foundation

The Trust Point System operationalizes The Bread Standard's value hierarchy:

1. **Love** - Recognition of inherent worth through equal base allocation
2. **Truth** - Transparent validation chains ensuring honesty in governance
3. **Mercy, Equity, and Responsibility** - Protected voices mechanisms for vulnerable populations
4. **Well-being** - Validation architecture emphasizing essential human needs
5. **Environmental Stewardship** - Appropriate representation for ecological concerns
6. **Community** - Federation supporting relationship across communities
7. **Innovation** - Adaptable voting authorities enabling experimentation
8. **Freedom** - Self-determination within boundaries through point allocation

### 1.2 Integration with The Bread Standard

The Trust Point System creates the validation architecture necessary for The Bread Standard's economic model:

- **Agricultural Foundation**: Agricultural validators receive specific authority over bread standard calculations
- **Societal Burden**: Essential service validators participate in burden calculation determinations
- **Economic Rights**: Trust point system ensures transparency in necessity guarantee management
- **Resource Allocation**: Value validators across sectors inform priority-setting for flourishment fund distribution

## 2. Core System Components

### 2.1 Federation Model

The architecture follows a federated design connecting individuals, communities, and domains including but not limited to:

- **Individual Level**: Personal trust point allocation
- **Community Level**: Local validators and governance
- **Domain Level**: Specialized validation in professional fields
- **Society Level**: Cross-domain coordination through federation

Key implementations include:
- Individual communities maintain sovereign instances
- Hierarchical validation flows upward from individuals to validators
- Cross-community recognition through standardized protocols
- Validators can form coalitions to govern larger domains

### 2.2 Trust Point Allocation Framework

#### Base Point Distribution
- Adults receive 1 trust point annually
- Children receive first point at age 10
- Parents/guardians control children's points until majority/emancipation
- Additional points earned through education/validation (up to maximum of 10)

#### Allocation Rules
- Up to 1 point per organization/validator
- Religious/political groups limited to 0.1 points per person
- Points refresh annually with 5-year investment cycle
- Decay rate: investment length (up to 5 years) minus 1/3 rounded up

#### Validator Weighting
- Organizations weighted by:
  - Number of supporting individuals
  - Total invested trust points
  - Validation score of point contributors
  - Domain expertise validation

### 2.3 Value Validator System

The Bread Standard specifically elevates the role of Value Validators - those with expertise in domains directly connected to society's foundational infrastructure and the bread standard's economic foundation.

#### Primary Value Validator Categories
1. **Agricultural Validators**: Expert understanding of food production systems directly related to the bread standard calculation
2. **Essential Infrastructure Validators**: Specialized knowledge in water systems, waste management, utilities, etc.
3. **Housing and Construction Validators**: Expertise in shelter necessities
4. **Healthcare Validators**: Knowledge of physical and mental wellbeing systems
5. **Governance and Community Coordination Validators**: Expertise in democratic processes
6. **Environmental Stewardship Validators**: Knowledge of ecological systems underpinning all human activity

#### Validator Registration Requirements

## 8. Conclusion: Democratic Infrastructure Supporting The Bread Standard

The Trust Point System forms the democratic foundation for The Bread Standard, integrating transparent governance with the food-based economic model. By elevating value validators from sectors essential to human flourishing, the system ensures that those with the most direct understanding of critical systems have appropriate influence in decisions affecting those domains.

This technical implementation creates a bridge between abstract values and practical expertise, connecting the philosophical principles of The Bread Standard with the real-world knowledge required to maintain essential infrastructure and services. The federated architecture allows for both local sovereignty and global coordination, creating a scalable system that can grow from small communities to planetary federation.

Through the governance application, The Bread Standard creates a transparent, verifiable system where all members of society can participate meaningfully while ensuring that decisions are informed by relevant expertise. The result is a democratic system grounded in both values and practical knowledge—one that recognizes both inherent human worth and specialized competence.

The technical implementation reflects The Bread Standard's value hierarchy by placing love (recognition of inherent worth) as the foundation through equal base point allocation, while creating space for truth (specialized knowledge) to inform critical decisions through the validator system. By systematizing mercy through protected voices mechanisms and environmental stewardship through specialized validator roles, the technology embodies rather than merely facilitates The Bread Standard's vision for a more humane society.
